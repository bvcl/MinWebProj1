In this study, Type I collagen was extracted from fish scales as a potential alternative source of collagen for tissue engineering applications. Since unmodified collagen typically has poor mechanical and degradation stability both in vitro and in vivo, additional methylation modification and 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDE) crosslinking steps were used to improve the physicochemical properties of fish scale-derived collagen. Subsequently, in vivo studies using a murine model demonstrated the biocompatibility of the different fish scale-derived collagen patches. In general, favorable integration of the collagen patches to the surrounding tissues, with good infiltration of cells, blood vessels (BVs) and lymphatic vessels (LVs) were observed under growth factor-free conditions. Interestingly, significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) number of LVs was found to be more abundant around collagen patches with methylation modification and BDE crosslinking. Overall, we have demonstrated the potential application of fish scale-derived collagen as a promising scaffolding material for various biomedical applications.
