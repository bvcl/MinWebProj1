In this study, Type I collagen was extracted from fish scales as a potential alternative source of collagen for tissue engineering applications. Since unmodified collagen typically has poor mechanical and degradation stability both in vitro and in vivo, additional methylation modification and 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDE) crosslinking steps were used to improve the physicochemical properties of fish scale-derived collagen. Subsequently, in vivo studies using a murine model demonstrated the biocompatibility of the different fish scale-derived collagen patches. In general, favorable integration of the collagen patches to the surrounding tissues, with good infiltration of cells, blood vessels (BVs) and lymphatic vessels (LVs) were observed under growth factor-free conditions. Interestingly, significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) number of LVs was found to be more abundant around collagen patches with methylation modification and BDE crosslinking. Overall, we have demonstrated the potential application of fish scale-derived collagen as a promising scaffolding material for various biomedical applications.SIGNIFICACNE: Currently the most common sources of collagen are of bovine and porcine origins, although the industrial use of collagen obtained from non-mammalian species is growing in importance, particularly since they have a lower risk of disease transmission and are not subjected to any cultural or religious constraints. However, unmodified collagen typically has poor mechanical and degradation stability both in vitro and in vivo. Hence, in this study, Type I collagen was successfully extracted from fish scales and chemically modified and crosslinked. In vitro studies showed overall improvement in the physicochemical properties of the material, whilst in vivo implantation studies showed improvements in the growth of blood and lymphatic host vessels in the vicinity of the implants.
