The destruction of the endometrium in women with heavy menstrual bleeding has been employed for well over a century and the various techniques of delivering forms of thermal energy have been modified over the years to assure a safe and effective treatment approach. Today, six non-resectoscopic devices are approved for use in the United States in addition to resectoscopic techniques that rely on skillful use of the operative hysteroscope. Regardless of the technique employed, endometrial ablation uniformly reduces menstrual blood loss, improves general and menstrual related quality of life and prevents hysterectomy in four out of five women who undergo the procedure. When patients are appropriately selected, outcomes are optimized and risks of serious complications are minimized. This article reviews the literature with singular reference to non-resectoscopic endometrial ablation procedures including historical background, appropriate patient selection, clinical outcomes data, complication and special or unique considerations.
