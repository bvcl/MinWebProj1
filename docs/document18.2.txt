Eyelid reconstruction is complex and challenging since it is not only for structural and functional restoration, but also for an acceptable aesthetic result. In full thickness eyelid injuries, it will involve both anterior and posterior lamella. Therefore, when reconstructing the defect, it requires at least two layers; one will be a flap with blood supply, and the other can be a free graft. In this case, a rotational advancement cheek flap and composite graft were used to reconstruct the lower eyelid.
