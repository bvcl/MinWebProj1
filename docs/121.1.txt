Since the present group had already described the composition of the intestinal microbiota of Brazilian infants under low social economic level, the aim of the present study was to analyze the microbial community structure changes in this group of infants during their early life due to external factors.METHODS: Fecal samples were collected from 11 infants monthly during the first year of life. The infants were followed regarding clinical and diet information and characterized according to breastfeeding practices. DNA was extracted from fecal samples of each child and subjected to PCR-DGGE analysis.RESULTS: The results revealed a pattern of similarity between the time points for those who were on exclusive breastfeeding or predominant breastfeeding. Although there were changes in intensity and fluctuation of some bands, the DGGE patterns in the one-year microbial analysis were stable for breastfeeding children. There was uninterrupted ecological succession despite the influence of external factors, such as complementary feeding and antibiotic administration, suggesting microbiota resilience. This was not observed for those children who had mixed feeding and introduction of solid food before the 5th month of life.CONCLUSION: These results suggested an intestinal microbiota pattern resilient to external forces, due to the probiotic and prebiotic effects of exclusive breastfeeding, reinforcing the importance of exclusive breastfeeding until the 6th month of life.
