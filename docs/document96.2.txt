This paper presents a novel technique to identify heartbeats in multimodal data using electrocardiogram (ECG) and arterial blood pressure (ABP) signals. Multiple physiological signals such as ECG, ABP, and Respiration are often recorded in parallel from the activity of heart. These signals generally possess related information as they are generated by the same physical system. The ECG and ABP correspond to the same phenomenon of contraction and relaxation activity of heart. Multiple signals acquired from various sensors are generally processed independently, thus discarding the information from other measurements. In the estimation of heart rate and heart rate variability, the R peaks are generally identified from ECG signal. Efficient detection of R-peaks in electrocardiogram (ECG) is a key component in the estimation of clinically relevant parameters from ECG. However, when the signal is severely affected by undesired artifacts, this becomes a challenging task. Sometimes in clinical environment, other physiological signals reflecting the cardiac activity such as ABP signal are also acquired simultaneously. Under the availability of such multimodal signals, the accuracy of R peak detection methods can be improved using sensor-fusion techniques. In the proposed method, the sample entropy (SampEn) is used as a metric for assessing the noise content in the physiological signal and the R peaks in ECG and the systolic peaks in ABP signals are fused together to enhance the efficiency of heartbeat detection. The proposed method was evaluated on the 100 records from the computing in cardiology challenge 2014 training data set. The performance parameters are: sensitivity (Se) and positive predictivity (PPV). The unimodal R peaks detector achieved: Se gross = 99.40%, PPV gross = 99.29%, Se average = 99.37%, PPV average = 99.29%. Similarly unimodal BP delineator achieved Se gross = 99.93%, PPV gross = 99.99%, Se average = 99.93%, PPV average = 99.99% whereas, the proposed multimodal beat detector achieved: Se gross = 99.65%, PPV gross = 99.91%, Se average = 99.68%, PPV average = 99.91%.
