The incidence of renal abscesses is not common. Patients usually have risk factors like diabetes mellitus or an underlying condition which predisposes to urinary tract infections. We report a case of a previously healthy young girl with multiple bilateral renal abscesses. Ultrasonography revealed multiple renal abscesses with a possible differential diagnosis of polycystic kidney disease with infected cysts. No renal calculi were seen. CT-scan of kidneys confirmed the diagnosis. Blood and urine cultures were repeatedly negative. She was treated with two weeks of intravenous antibiotics followed by another four weeks of oral Ciprofloxacin. No surgical intervention was carried out. Repeated ultrasound at six months showed complete resolution of all the renal abscesses.
