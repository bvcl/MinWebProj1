Here, we describe the use of complementary techniques applicable to different types of samples to analyze chromosomal alterations in urothelial carcinoma. By a conventional chromosome analysis on fresh biopsies, it is possible to delineate the status of ploidy and rough chromosomal aberrations. The multi-target fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) UroVysion test, for the rapid detection of chromosomal aneusomy of chromosomes 3, 7, and 17 and/or deletion of 9p21 locus, is applicable to urine specimens as well as to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens and fresh biopsies. Finally, array comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) gives the possibility of analyzing the DNA in a single experiment from a biopsy of the tumor but also from FFPE specimens; this technique is able to detect alterations at the genome level not excluding any chromosome.
