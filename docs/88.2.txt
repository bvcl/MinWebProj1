There is good evidence that controlling hypertension reduces the risk of stroke and other cardiovascular consequences of hypertension. The recent Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) trial, stopped early because of a higher risk among participants randomized to the higher blood pressure target, will no doubt lead to calls for even lower pressures. Even among participants age â‰¥75, those randomized to a target systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt; 120 mmHg had a lower risk of stroke and cardiovascular events compared with a SBP target &lt;140 mmHg[1]. However, there are reasons to be cautious about aiming for very low systolic pressures in all elderly patients. Those with stiff arteries, identifiable by a wide pulse pressure, may be harmed by very low diastolic pressures. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
