Ciprofloxacin (CIP) biodegradation was investigated using enrichments obtained in the presence of magnetite nanoparticles, CIP and human fecal sewage. CIP addition inhibited methanogenic activity and altered the bacterial community composition. The magnetite-supplemented enrichments significantly promoted CIP biodegradation, especially in the presence of 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES). When BES was added, CIP biodegradation in the magnetite-supplemented enrichments was 67% higher than in the magnetite-unamended enrichments. Fe (II) concentrations were also significantly increased in the BES and magnetite-supplemented enrichments. This indicated that there might be a positive relationship of CIP biodegradation with microbial reduction of Fe (III) to Fe (II). As for the magnetite-supplemented enrichments, DNA-sequencing analysis revealed that Stenotrophomonas was the dominant genus, while Desulfovibrio became the dominant genus in the presence of BES. These two genera might be related to Fe (III) reduction in the magnetite. The findings provide a strategy for improving CIP biodegradation during waste treatment.
