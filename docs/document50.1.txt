DNA methylation was the first epigenetic modification to be detected in human cancers with specific relation to aberrant gene expression. Herein, DNA methylation analysis explains how epigenetic patterns affect gene expression level. Hypermethylation at tumor suppressor gene loci leads to increased tumorigenesis due to tumor suppressor gene silencing, whereas global hypomethylation of CpG islands (CGIs) is followed by genomic instability and aberrant activation of multiple oncogenes. Therefore, characterization of the genes which silenced or activated epigenetically in human tumor cells can improve our understanding of cancer biology. Different genome-wide methodologies are applied to evaluate methylation status. Various commonly conducted techniques for this evaluation are reviewed in this paper. We provided comparative description of the procedures, advantages, and drawbacks of genome-wide DNA methylation analysis methods and biological applications, to give information on selecting the appropriate method for different methylation studies.
