We investigated the haemodynamic effects of two-week liquorice exposure (glycyrrhizin dose 290-370 mg/day) in 22 healthy volunteers during orthostatic challenge. Haemodynamics were recorded during passive 10-minute head-up tilt using radial pulse wave analysis, whole-body impedance cardiography, and spectral analysis of heart rate variability. Thirty age-matched healthy subjects served as controls. Liquorice ingestion elevated radial systolic (p &lt; 0.001) and diastolic (p = 0.018) blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance (p = 0.037). During orthostatic challenge, heart rate increased less after the liquorice versus control diet (p = 0.003) and low frequency power of heart rate variability decreased within the liquorice group (p = 0.034). Liquorice intake increased central pulse pressure (p &lt; 0.001) and augmentation index (p = 0.002) supine and upright, but in the upright position the elevation of augmentation index was accentuated (p = 0.007). Liquorice diet also increased extracellular fluid volume (p = 0.024) and aortic to popliteal pulse wave velocity (p = 0.027), and aortic characteristic impedance in the upright position (p = 0.002). To conclude, in addition to increased extracellular fluid volume and large arterial stiffness, two weeks of liquorice ingestion elevated systemic vascular resistance and augmentation index. Measurements performed at rest may underestimate the haemodynamic effects of liquorice ingestion, as enhanced central wave reflection and reduced chronotropic response were especially observed in the upright position.
