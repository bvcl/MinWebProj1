The process of natural selection favours germ-line gene segments that encode CDRs that have the ability to recognize a range of structurally related antigens. This presents an immunological advantage to the host, as it can confer protection against a common pathogen and still cope with new or changing antigens. Cross-reactive and polyspecific antibodies also play a central role in autoimmune responses, and a link has been shown to exist between auto-reactive B cells and certain bacterial infections. Bacterial DNA, lipids, and carbohydrates have been implicated in the progression of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. As well, reports of anti-lipid A antibody polyspecificity towards single-stranded DNA together with the observed sequence homology amongst isolated auto- and anti-lipid A antibodies has prompted further study of this phenomenon. Though the lipid A epitope appears cryptic during Gram-negative bacterial infection, there have been several reported instances of lipid A-specific antibodies isolated from human sera, some of which have exhibited polyspecificity for single stranded DNA. In such cases, the breakdown of negative selection through polyspecificity can have the unfortunate consequence of autoimmune disease. This review summarizes current knowledge regarding such antibodies and emphasizes the features of S1-15, A6, and S55-5, anti-lipid A antibodies whose structures were recently determined by X-ray crystallography.
