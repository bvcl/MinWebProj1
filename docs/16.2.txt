In order to test the validity of the selected surgical technique as a way to manage persistent synovitis of the knee joint, as well as to slow down the cartilage and bone destruction, we studied the dynamics of biomarkers of inflammatory conditions, and bone and cartilage destruction after total arthroscopic synovectomy (TAS) of the knee joint.METHODS: The sampling comprised 124 RA patients (158 knees) who had undergone the TAS procedure between 2003 and 2015. Before surgery the rheumatoid factor (IgM), C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate test was completed for all patients. Blood serum samples were collected (prior to surgery, and three, six and 12 months after surgery) and frozen at -70°С. The content of CRP, Matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), Cartilage Oligomeric Matrix Protein, as well as cross-linked Ctelopeptides of types I and II were measured in blood serum by means of polarization fluoroimmunoassay with the use of a standard set of reagents.RESULTS: The average duration of the disease in the studied group was 8.7 ± 6.6 years. Concentration of the inflammation markers showed that only MMP-3 displayed statistical significance.CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results can be used as basis in assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of this method of treatment of persistent knee joint synovitis associated with the RA.
