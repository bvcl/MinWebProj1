The use of tranexamic acid (TXA) in total hip arthroplasty (THA) can significantly reduce blood losses with many clinical and economical advantages. However, no consensus has been reached regarding the optimal regimen for TXA administration. The aim of this study is to analyse and compare the haemostatic effect of two different intravenous (IV) regimens of TXA.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We planned a single-centre, prospective, randomized study including 80 patients who underwent primary unilateral minimally invasive THA because of a hip osteoarthritic degeneration. We divided patients into two groups: the G10 group received two IV doses of 10 mg/kg of TXA, and the G20 group received two doses of 20 mg/kg.RESULTS: No significant differences in mean minimum levels of Hb and HcT stratified by days after surgery were uncovered between the two groups despite the use of two different dosages of TXA. Also the mean blood volume loss was statistically similar between two groups. No differences were also observed regarding the occurrence of adverse effects.CONCLUSIONS: In two IV bolus regimens of TXA administration, the use of a dose of 10 or 20 mg/kg provides statistically similar results in blood loss sparing. Therefore, the use of two 10 mg/kg doses could be considered more advisable in order to reduce the potential thromboembolic risks related to this drug.
