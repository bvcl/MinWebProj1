Previous studies have reported genome-wide mutation profile analyses in ovarian clear cell carcinomas (OCCCs). This study aims to identify specific novel molecular alterations by combined analyses of somatic mutation and copy number variation. We performed whole exome sequencing of 39 OCCC samples with 16 matching blood tissue samples. Four hundred twenty-six genes had recurrent somatic mutations. Among the 39 samples, ARID1A (62%) and PIK3CA (51%) were frequently mutated, as were genes such as KRAS (10%), PPP2R1A (10%), and PTEN (5%), that have been reported in previous OCCC studies. We also detected mutations in MLL3 (15%), ARID1B (10%), and PIK3R1 (8%), which are associations not previously reported. Gene interaction analysis and functional assessment revealed that mutated genes were clustered into groups pertaining to chromatin remodeling, cell proliferation, DNA repair and cell cycle checkpointing, and cytoskeletal organization. Copy number variation analysis identified frequent amplification in chr8q (64%), chr20q (54%), and chr17q (46%) loci as well as deletion in chr19p (41%), chr13q (28%), chr9q (21%), and chr18q (21%) loci. Integration of the analyses uncovered that frequently mutated or amplified/deleted genes were involved in the KRAS/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (82%) and MYC/retinoblastoma (75%) pathways as well as the critical chromatin remodeling complex switch/sucrose nonfermentable (85%). The individual and integrated analyses contribute details about the OCCC genomic landscape, which could lead to enhanced diagnostics and therapeutic options.
