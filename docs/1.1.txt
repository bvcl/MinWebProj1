Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) is an age-related malignant lymphoma, characterized by immune system-dysregulated symptoms. Recent sequencing studies have clarified the recurrent mutations in ras homology family member A (RHOA) and in genes encoding epigenetic regulators, tet methyl cytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2), DNA methyl transferase 3 alpha (DNMT3A), and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2, mitochondrial (IDH2), as well as those related to the T-cell receptor signaling pathway in AITL. In this review, we will focus on how this genetic information has changed the understanding of the developmental process of AITL and will in future lead to individualized therapies for AITL patients.
