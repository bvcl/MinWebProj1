Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive malignancies worldwide. Emerging evidence indicates that aberrantly expressed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) act as imperative roles in tumorigenesis and progression. PANDAR (promoter of CDKN1A antisense DNA damage activated RNA) is a novel lncRNA that contributes to the development of various cancers. However, its clinical significance and potential effects on PDAC remains unknown. In the present study, qRT-PCR was performed to explore the expression levels of PANDAR in PDAC tissues and corresponding non-tumor tissues, the correlation between PANDAR expression and clinicopathological characteristics was also analyzed. The functional roles of lncRNA PANDAR in PDAC cells were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. The results indicated that PANDAR was aberrantly overexpressed in PDAC tissues and cell lines, and this overexpression was closely associated with tumor stage and vascular invasion in PDAC patients. Besides, silencing of PANDAR exerted tumor suppressive effect via reducing cell proliferation, colony-forming ability, inducing cell cycle G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis in PANC1 and Capan-2 cells. Further in vivo study confirmed the oncogenesis role of PANDAR in PDAC cells. Overall, our findings may help to develop a potential therapeutic target for the patients with PDAC.
