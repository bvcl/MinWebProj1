Aging is a natural process in living organisms that is defined by some molecular and cellular changes with time. Various causes such as mitochondrial DNA aberrations, aggregation of proteins, telomere shortening, and oxidative stress have an influential role in aging of the cells. Natural antioxidants are compounds that are potent to protect the body from detrimental effects of molecules such as free radicals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-aging properties of ellagic acid (EA) and silybin (SIL), as natural antioxidant compounds on rat embryonic fibroblast (REF) cells. These cells were pre-incubated with EA and SIL, thereafter were exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Then, the cell viability, SA-β-GAL activity, distribution of cell cycle, NF-κB, and mitochondrial complex I, II/IV enzyme activity were measured. The results of this study revealed the protective effects of EA and SIL in H2O2-treated REF cells, which confirm the previous achieved data on antioxidant and anti-inflammatory characteristics of EA and SIL against H2O2 in the treated REF cells. However, more new in vivo experiments are required to discover the anti-aging effects and mechanism of action of such compounds.
