Embolic ischemia and pulmonary embolism are health emergencies that arise when a particle such as a blood clot occludes a smaller blood vessel in the brain or the lungs, and restricts flow of blood downstream of the vessel. In this work, the reflow technique (Wang et al. Biomed. Microdevices 2007, 9, 657) was adapted to produce a microchannel network that mimics the occlusion process. The technique was first revisited and a simple geometrical model was developed to quantitatively explain the shapes of the resulting microchannels for different reflow parameters. A critical modification was introduced to the reflow protocol to fabricate nearly circular microchannels of different diameters from the same master, which is not possible with the traditional reflow technique. To simulate the phenomenon of occlusion by clots, a microchannel network with three generations of branches with different diameters and branching angles was fabricated, into which fibrin clots were introduced. At low constant pressure drop (ΔP), a clot blocked a branch entrance only partially, while at higher ΔP, the branch was completely blocked. Instances of simultaneous blocking of multiple channels by clots, and the consequent changes in the flow rates in the unblocked branches of the network, were also monitored. This work provides the framework for a systematic study of the distribution of clots in a network, and the rate of dissolution of embolic clots upon the introduction of a thrombolytic drug into the network.
