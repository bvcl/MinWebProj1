Tumor oxygenation has been correlated with treatment outcome for radiotherapy. In this work, the dependence of tumor oxygenation on tumor vascularity and blood oxygenation was determined quantitatively in a 4D stochastic computational model of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumor growth and angiogenesis. Additionally, the impacts of the tumor oxygenation and the cancer stem cell (CSC) symmetric division probability on the tumor volume doubling time and the proportion of CSCs in the tumor were also quantified. Clinically relevant vascularities and blood oxygenations for HNSCC yielded tumor oxygenations in agreement with clinical data for HNSCC. The doubling time varied by a factor of 3 from well oxygenated tumors to the most severely hypoxic tumors of HNSCC. To obtain the doubling times and CSC proportions clinically observed in HNSCC, the model predicts a CSC symmetric division probability of approximately 2% before treatment. To obtain the doubling times clinically observed during treatment when accelerated repopulation is occurring, the model predicts a CSC symmetric division probability of approximately 50%, which also results in CSC proportions of 30-35% during this time.
