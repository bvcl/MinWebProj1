A series of new 1,3,4-oxadiazole-2(3H)-thione analogues (3a to 3o) have been designed, synthesized and evaluated for their anticancer activity. Four different cancerous cell lines viz. HeLa (cervical), U-87 (glioblastoma), Panc (pancreatic) and MCF-7 (breast) were used to assess the potency of the synthesized compounds as anticancer agents. Among them 3i and 3j showed promising cytotoxicity against HeLa cell line. Further, 3i and 3j successfully inhibited cell cycle progression and displayed cell death in HeLa cells via apoptosis as visualized by Annexin V APC and DNA fragmentation assay. 3i and 3j induced caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage, increase in expression of proapoptotic protein Bax and decrease in the expression of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. Also, 3i and 3j induced overexpression of p21 and decreased expression of cyclin B1 indicating the arrest of cells in G2-M phase of the cell cycle. Therefore, new lead compounds are being suggested having anticancer activity through cell cycle inhibition and apoptosis.
