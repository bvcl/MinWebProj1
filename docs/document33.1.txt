In the present study, pearl millet cultivar PUSA-415 was fermented by solid state fermentation (SSF) process using Aspergillus sojae (MTCC-8779) as starter culture. The fermentation was carried out for the period of ten days. The effect of SSF on phenolic content, condensed tannin content, antioxidant potential and DNA damage protection of pearl millet during different fermentation period was determined. Results showed that SSF and thermal processing significantly affect the bioactive profile and antioxidant potential of bio-transformed pearl millet. Extracts prepared from 6th days fermented pearl millet flour exhibited the highest TPC, antioxidant potential and DNA damage protection activity. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of bioactive compounds were done by HPLC. During SSF, production of enzymes (α-amylase, β-glucosidase and xylanase) as well as specific bioactive compounds (ascorbic acid, gallic acid and p-Coumaric acid) was significantly increased. Thus, bio-transformed Aspergillus sojae fermented pearl millet could be used in preparation of functional foods and novel nutraceuticals in health promotions. Chapatti was formulated from unfermented as well as fermented flour and the effect of thermal processing on bioactive compounds and antioxidant potential was studied. Thermal processing resulted in decrease in TPC of both, AFM and UFM by 4.75-16.27% and increase in CTC by 38.52-67.41%.
