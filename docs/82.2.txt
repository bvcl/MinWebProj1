γδ T cells are non-conventional, innate-like T cells, characterized by a restricted TCR repertoire. They participate in protective immunity response against extracellular and intracellular pathogens, tumor surveillance, modulation of innate and adaptive immune responses, tissue healing, epithelial cell maintenance, and regulation of physiological organ function. In this study, we investigated the role of neutrophils during the activation of human blood γδ T cells through CD3 molecules. We found that the up-regulation of CD69 expression, and the production of IFN-γ and TNF-α induced by anti-CD3 antibodies were potentiated by neutrophils. We found that inhibition of caspase-1 and neutralization of IL-18 did not affect neutrophil-mediated modulation. By contrast, the treatment with serine proteases inhibitors prevented the potentiation of γδ T cell activation induced by neutrophils. Moreover, the addition of elastase to γδ T cell culture increased their stimulation, and the treatment of neutrophils with elastase inhibitor prevented the effect of neutrophils on γδ T cell activation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the effect of elastase on γδ T cells was mediated through the proteases-activated receptor, PAR1, since the inhibition of this receptor with a specific antagonist, RWJ56110, abrogated the effect of neutrophils on γδ T cell activation.
