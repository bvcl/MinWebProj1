The hemostatic properties of surface modified chitosan nonwoven had been investigated. The succinyl groups, carboxymethyl groups and quaternary ammonium groups were introduced into the surface of chitosan nonwoven (obtained NSCS, CMCS and TMCS nonwoven, respectively). For blood clotting, absorbance value (0.105±0.03) of NSCS1 nonwoven was the smallest (CS 0.307±0.002, NSCS2 0.148±0.002, CMCS1 0.195±0.02, CMCS2 0.233±0.001, TMCS1 0.191±0.002, TMCS2 0.345±0.002), which indicated the stronger hemostatic potential. For platelet aggregation, adenosine diphosphate agonist was added to induce the nonwoven to adhered platelets. The aggregation of platelet with TMCS2 nonwoven was highest (10.97±0.16%). Further research of blood coagulation mechanism was discussed, which indicated NSCS and CMCS nonwoven could activate the intrinsic pathway of coagulation to accelerate blood coagulation. NSCS1 nonwoven showed the shortest hemostatic time (147±3.7s) and the lowest blood loss (0.23±0.05g) in a rabbit ear artery injury model. These results demonstrated that these surface modified chitosan nonwoven dressings could use as a promising hemostatic intervention, especially NSCS nonwoven dressing.
