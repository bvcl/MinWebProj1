A previously healthy 60-year-old patient presented to the emergency department with severe headache, altered personality and fever. He was treated for bacterial meningitis with delirium of unknown cause but presumed to be due to alcohol withdrawal. Despite receiving the antibiotic therapy regimen recommended for bacterial meningitis the patient's condition rapidly deteriorated with profound delirium and tachypnea. The intensivist who was consulted immediately suspected sepsis-associated organ failure and admitted the patient to the intensive care unit (ICU). The blood culture was positive for Listeria. After 10 days the patient could be discharged from the ICU and ultimately recovered completely. In patients presenting with unexplained delirium or altered personality the suspicion of septic encephalopathy should always be considered. They should be admitted to the ICU and sepsis treatment should be initiated without delay.
