Several studies reported the potential role of the rs1447295 polymorphism in susceptibility to cancer. This variant located in the cancer susceptibility candidate 8 (CASC8) is a long noncoding RNA (lnRNA) gene and does not code protein. LnRNA transcripts play a potential regulatory role in the expression of key genes involved in multiple cellular pathways, including cell cycle, pluripotency, and immune response. The aim of this study is to evaluate this association with colorectal cancer (CRC) in a large case-control study of the Iranian population. After extraction of genomic DNA by the standard protocols, the rs1447295 was genotyped in 2416 subjects (46% patients). Results of this case-control demonstrated no significant association between the rs1447295 polymorphism and risk of CRC or its characteristics under allele or alternative genotype models. In conclusion, it is unlikely that the rs1447295 polymorphism is a risk variant for the development of CRC in Iranian population.
