Herein, two polypyridyl ruthenium(II) complexes with alkynes, [Ru(bpy)2L](ClO4)2 (L=p-TEPIP (1) and p-BEPIP (2); bpy=2,2'-bipyridine; p-TEPIP=2-(4-trimethylsilylpropargyl)-1H-imidazo[4,5f][1,10]phenanthroline; p-BEPIP=2-(4-phenyacetylenephenyl)-1H-imidazo[4,5f][1,10]phenanthroline) have been successfully achieved in yields of 32%-89% by a Sonogashira coupling reaction under microwave irradiation. We studied these complexes as potential stabilizers of c-myc G-quadruplex DNA. Observations revealed that both complexes could selectively bind to and stabilize c-myc G-quadruplex DNA with a constant of approximately 1.61±0.78 and 9.47±4.20×103M-1, respectively, as determined from ITC (isothermal ttitration calorimetry) experiments, FRET (fluorescence resonance energy ttransfer) assay and competitive FRET assay. Moreover, the melting point (Tm) of the c-myc G-quadruplex DNA increased in the presence of 1 and 2 ([Ru]=0.2μM) by approximately 9 and 19.9°C, respectively. It is noteworthy that the conformation of the c-myc G-quadruplex DNA appeared to change when titrated with 1 and 2, which was accompanied by a negative-induced CD (circular dichroism) signal that appeared at a wavelength of 295nm. Furthermore, the conformational change in c-myc G-quadruplex DNA induced by 1 and 2have also been confirmed by TEM (transmission electron microscopy) and AFM (atomic force microscopy). Consequently, the replication of c-myc DNA was blocked by 1 and 2, and especially by 2, as verified by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) -stop assay and Western-blot assay. Thus, these ruthenium(II) complexes can be developed as potential inhibitors in chemotherapy through their binding and stabilization of c-myc G-quadruplex DNA.
