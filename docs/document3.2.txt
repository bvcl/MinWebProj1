Circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) can be found in various body fluids, i.e., blood (serum and plasma), urine, pleural effusions, and ascites. While ccfDNA predominantly originates from physiological processes, a fraction might be related to pathological events, e.g., cancer. Aberrant DNA methylation, which is considered a hallmark of cancer, can be assessed accurately in ccfDNA. Consequently, DNA methylation testing in body fluids represents a powerful diagnostic tool in the clinical management of malignant diseases. Frequently, however, the total amount of disease-related ccfDNA in a sample is low and masked by an excess of physiological ccfDNA. Thus, DNA methylation analysis of tumor-derived DNA is challenging, and high volumes of body fluids need to be analyzed in order to ensure a sufficient abundance of the analyte in the test sample. DNA methylation assays are usually based on prior conversion of cytosines to uracils by means of bisulfite. This reaction takes place under harsh chemical conditions leading to DNA degradation and therefore necessitates a proper DNA purification before downstream analyses. This article describes a protocol which allows for the preparation of ultra-pure bisulfite-converted DNA from up to 3Â ml blood plasma and serum, which is well suited for subsequent molecular biological techniques, e.g., methylation-specific real-time PCR.
