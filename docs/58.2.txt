Polymorphism in vitamin D binding protein gene may have an impact on serum vitamin D transport and thus may have relation with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In our study, we investigated the association of serum vitamin D level and vitamin D-binding protein gene polymorphism with the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 104 type 2 diabetic patients and 107 healthy volunteers. Serum vitamin D was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Genetic analysis of vitamin D-binging protein gene was carried out by polymerase chain reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism method.RESULTS: We found significantly (p&lt;0.001) lower level of vitamin D in type 2 diabetic patients compared to control subjects. A significantly negative correlation (r=-0.25, p&lt;0.05) between vitamin D level and fasting blood glucose level was found among type 2 diabetic subjects. The Glu/Glu at codon 416 (rs7041) (p&lt;0.05) and Lys/Lys at codon 420 (rs4588) (p&lt;0.01) variants of vitamin D binding protein gene was significantly higher in type 2 diabetic subjects than controls. The patients with Glu/Glu and Lys/Lys genotypes respectively at codon 416 (odds ratio=2.87; 95% confidence interval=1.19 to 6.95) and 420 (odds ratio=8.9; 95% confidence interval=1.89 to 41.99) were at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes.CONCLUSIONS: Our present study strongly suggests that there might have an association of vitamin D, and vitamin D-binding protein gene (codon 416 &amp; 420) polymorphisms with the occurrence of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
