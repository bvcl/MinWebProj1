The polymyxins have become one of the last resorts to treat serious infections caused by KPC-2-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae worldwide. However, the increase of polymyxin consumption has favored the emergence of resistance to these compounds. In this study we observed an increase in the polymyxin B resistance rates from 0 to 30.6% among 224 K. pneumoniae isolates recovered from blood cultures between 2009 and 2015. Only gentamicin, tigecycline and fosfomycin remained active against the polymyxin B-resistant K. pneumoniae (PMB-R-KPN) isolates, which were classified as XDR (83.3%), MDR (13.9%), or pan-drug resistant (2.8%). Most PMB-R-KPN clones belonged to CC258 (ST11, ST258, ST340 and ST437). A C7/ST258 XDR clone carrying distinct resistance determinants (blaSHV-11, blaTEM-1, blaCTX-M-15, blaCTX-M-14, blaKPC-2, and rmtB-1) was introduced in 2014. Twelve of 36 PMB-R-KPN isolates showed disruption of mgrB. No mcr-1 positive isolate was found. The rapid detection the PMB-R-KPN isolates allied to implementation of effective infection control measures are of crucial importance to avoid the dissemination of high-risk PMB-R-KPN clones.
