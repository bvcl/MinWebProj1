We investigated the effects of the DPP4 inhibitor, teneligliptin, on cardiac function and hemodynamics during heart failure in hypertensive model rats.METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-five male Dahl salt-sensitive rats were divided into four groups: control group (0.3% NaCl chow, n=13), hypertension (HT) group (8% NaCl chow, n=20), HT-early TNL group (8% NaCl chow and teneligliptin from 6 weeks, n=10), and HT-late TNL group (8% NaCl chow and teneligliptin from 10 weeks, n=12). Hemodynamic measurement and tissue analyses were performed at 18 weeks. In the all HT groups, systolic blood pressures and similarly elevated (p=0.66) and heart weight similarly increased (p=0.36) with or without TNL administration. LV end-diastolic dimension was significantly enlarged only in the HT-early TNL groups compared with control group (p=0.025). Histological analysis showed less fibrosis (p=0.008) and cardiomyocyte widths (p=0.009) in the HT-early TNL group compare with HT group. On hemodynamic analysis, only HT group showed significant LV end-diastolic pressure elevation (p=0.049) and lung congestion (p&lt;0.001) compare with control group.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest teneligliptin prevents concentric LV hypertrophy, fibrosis, and development of congestive heart failure in Dahl salt-sensitive rats. Teneligliptin may inhibit pressure-overload hypertrophic adaption and result in LV eccentric hypertrophy with reduced LV ejection fraction.
