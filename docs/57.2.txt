To examine the influence of compliance on the beneficial effect of aspirin in prevention of preterm preeclampsia in the Combined Multimarker Screening and Randomized Patient Treatment with Aspirin for Evidence-Based Preeclampsia Prevention (ASPRE) trial.STUDY DESIGN: This was a secondary analysis of data from the ASPRE trial. In this multicenter-study women with singleton pregnancies had screening by means of an algorithm that combines maternal factors and biomarkers (mean arterial pressure, uterine-artery pulsatility index, and maternal serum pregnancy-associated plasma protein A and placental growth factor) at 11-13 weeks' gestation. Those with an estimated risk for preterm preeclampsia of &gt;1 in 100 were invited to participate in a double-blind trial of aspirin (150 mg per day) vs. placebo from 11 to 14 until 36 weeks' gestation. Preterm preeclampsia with delivery at &lt;37 weeks' gestation, which was the primary outcome, occurred in 1.6% (13/798) participants in the aspirin group, as compared with 4.3% (35/822) in the placebo group (odds ratio in the aspirin group, 0.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.20 to 0.74). The proportion of prescribed tablets taken was used as an overall measure of compliance. Logistic-regression analysis was used to estimate the effect of aspirin on the incidence of preterm preeclampsia according to compliance of &lt;90% and &gt;90%, after adjustment for the estimated risk of preterm preeclampsia at screening and the participating center. The choice of cut-off of 90% was based on an exploratory analysis of the treatment effect. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate predictors of compliance &gt;90% among maternal characteristics and medical history.RESULTS: Preterm preeclampsia occurred in 5/555 (0.9%) participants in the aspirin group with compliance ≥90%, in 8/243 (3.3%) of participants in the aspirin group with compliance &lt;90%, in 22/588 (3.7%) of participants in the placebo group with compliance ≥90%, and in 13/234 (5.6%) of participants in the placebo group with compliance &lt;90%. The odds ratio in the aspirin group for preterm preeclampsia was 0.24 (95% confidence interval, 0.09 to 0.65) for compliance &gt;90% and 0.59 (95% confidence interval, 0.23 to 1.53) for compliance &lt;90%. Compliance was positively associated with family history of preeclampsia and negatively associated with smoking, maternal age &lt;25 years, Afro-Caribbean and South Asian racial origin, and history of preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy.CONCLUSIONS: The beneficial effect of aspirin in the prevention of preterm preeclampsia appears to depend on compliance.
