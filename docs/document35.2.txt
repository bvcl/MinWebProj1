Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can rarely cause severe manifestations in immunocompetent individuals. Hereby, we report a twelve-year-old boy who presented with tachycardia, tachypnea, fever and leukocytosis, which progressed to hypoxemic respiratory failure and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Subsequently, he developed multi-organ failure despite the ongoing full supportive care and empiric broad spectrum antibiotics. Cytomegalovirus infection was diagnosed by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) in blood and histopathological examination of lung biopsy. Immunological work up for the child was unremarkable. Ganciclovir therapy was introduced and showed significant improvement until full recovery. However, our patient developed transient heart block as a rare complication for Ganciclovir therapy throughout his course. We present this case with literature review for the CMV infection associated morbidity and mortality among immunocompetent children.
