Giardia duodenalis is the most common gastrointestinal protozoan parasite of humans and a significant contributor to the global burden of both diarrheal disease and post-infectious chronic disorders. Robust tools for analyzing gene function in this parasite have been developed and a range of genetic tools are now available. These together with public databases have provided insights on the function of different genes in Giardia. In this review we provide a current perspective on different molecular aspects of Giardia related to genomics, regulation of encystation, trophozoite transcriptional responses to physiological and xenobiotic (drug-induced) stress, and mechanisms of drug resistance. We also examine recent insights that have contributed to gain knowledge in the study of VSPs, antigenic variation, epigenetics, DNA repair and in the direct manipulation of gene function in Giardia, with a particular focus on the inducible Cre/loxP system.
