Blood specimens are transported from clinical departments to the biochemistry laboratory by hospital courier service, sometimes over long distances. The aim of this study was to assess the stability of common biochemical analytes in venous blood under our routine transport conditions and to evaluate analyte stability after prompt or delayed centrifugation.METHODS: We investigated pre- and postanalytical contributions of 32 biochemical analytes in plasma and serum samples from 10 patients (healthy adults and patients from intensive care units). Differences in analyte concentrations between baseline (T0) and different time intervals (2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h) following storage after prompt and delayed centrifugation were reported. Evaluation was against the total change limit as described by Oddoze et al. (Oddoze C, Lombard E, Portugal H. Stability study of 81 analytes in human whole blood, in serum and in plasma. Clin Biochem 2012;45:464-9).RESULTS: The majority of analytes were stable with delayed separation up to 12 h, except for potassium, C-peptide, osteocalcin, parathyroid hormone (PTH), bicarbonate and LDH. After prompt centrifugation and storage at 4Â°C, stability was greatly increased up to 48 h for most analytes. LDH and bicarbonate had the lowest stability after centrifugation; therefore, no reanalysis of these analytes in a centrifuged tube can be allowed.CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of analyte stability is crucial to interpret biological analysis with confidence. However, centrifugation prior to transport is time consuming, and the transfer of plasma or serum from a primary tube to a secondary tube increases the risk of preanalytical errors. For analytes that are stable in whole blood for 24 h or more, it seems that there is no benefit to centrifuge before transport.
