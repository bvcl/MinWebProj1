Although hard training is mandatory in elite level futsal training, few studies have proposed a biochemical follow up in futsal players during a whole season. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare functional and biochemical markers in Brazilian elite level futsal players throughout a competition season.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight players aged 25.5±5.4 years were evaluated at three time points: preseason (T1), immediately before the FIFA®-Intercontinental-Futsal-Cup (T2), and at the end of the season (T3), with a tapering period of 1 week before T2. Functional parameters (weight, height, body fat, VO2max, heart rate, and distance ran) and blood sampling for cell count and lipid profile (cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides) were assessed at each time point. After, a Yo-Yo R2 test was carried out in each time point (T1, T2 and T3) and blood samples to assess skeletal muscle damage (creatine kinase [CK], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]), inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP]) and oxidative stress markers (ischemia modified albumin [IMA], and advanced oxidation protein products [AOPP]) were obtained before and after the tests.RESULTS: Although functional parameters did not change throughout the season, greater total number of erythrocytes (P≤0.05), and hemoglobin (P≤0.05) were found at T2 compared to T1. Similarly, lower LDH (P≤0.05) and CK (P≤0.05) levels were found at T2 compared to T1. CPR levels were also decreased at T2 in comparison to T1 both before and after Yo-Yo R2 test (P≤0.05), while IMA and AOPP levels showed only a season effect (P≤0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The tapering strategy was successful considering players presented lower levels of muscle damage, inflammation and oxidative stress makers before T2, which preceded the main championship of the year. These results are of great relevance, considering the team won the FIFA®-Intercontinental-Futsal-Cup, which happened at T2. Thus, it seems that routine-based biochemical markers may be useful as training control means in this population.
