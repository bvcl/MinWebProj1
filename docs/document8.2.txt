We investigated if blood flow restriction (BFR, cuff pressure 20 mmHG below individual occlusion pressure) increases metabolic stress, hormonal response, release of muscle damage markers, and muscle swelling induced by moderate-intensity eccentric contractions. In a randomized, matched-pair design, 20 male subjects (25.3 ± 3.3 years) performed four sets of unilateral eccentric knee extensions (75% 1RM) to volitional failure with (IG) or without (CG) femoral BFR. Despite significant differences of performed repetitions between IG (85.6 ± 15.4 repetitions) and CG (142.3 ± 44.1 repetitions), peak values of lactate (IG 7.0 ± 1.4 mmol l-1, CG 6.9 ± 2.7 mmol l-1), growth-hormone (IG 4.9 ± 4.8 ng ml-1, CG 5.2 ± 3.5 ng ml-1), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IG 172.1 ± 41.9 ng ml-1, CG 178.7 ± 82.1 ng ml-1), creatine-kinase (IG 625.5 ± 464.8 U l-1, CG 510.7 ± 443.5 U l-1), the absolute neutrophil count (IG 7.9 ± 1.3 103 µl-1, CG 8.7 ± 2.0 103 µl-1), induced muscle swelling of rectus femoris and vastus lateralis and perceived pain did not differ. The present data indicate that BFR is suitable to intensify eccentric exercises.
