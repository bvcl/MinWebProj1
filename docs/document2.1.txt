Immunocytological staining with adduct-specific antibodies allows the visualization and measurement of structurally defined types of DNA damage in the nuclei of individual cells. Here we describe an immunocytological assay (ICA) procedure for the localization and quantification of such damage, in particular induced by platinum-based anticancer drugs, in cell lines , in primary cell suspensions and in frozen tissue sections.
