Increasingly, epidemiological evidences indicate chemosynthetic perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), an environmental pollutant, induces potential adverse effect on human health after long-term exposure. However, less study has been performed for assessment of acute effect of PFOA exposure on metabolic homeostasis. In experimental designs, PFOA-exposed liver cells in vivo and in vitro were used to discuss underlying mechanism related to PFOA-induced metabolic dysfunction. In serological tests, PFOA-exposed mice showed increased treads of liver functional enzymes in alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and total bilirubin (T-BIL), trypsinase, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and insulin, while blood glucose, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), and glucagon levels were reduced. In histocytological observations, PFOA-exposed liver showed visible cytoplasmic vesicles, and intact pancreatic islets were observed in PFOA-exposed pancreas. Additionally, increased insulin-positive cells and reduced glucagon-positive cells were detected in PFOA-exposed islets. As shown in immunoassays, PFOA-exposed liver resulted in elevations of cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36)-labeled cells and CD36 protein. In mouse liver cell study, PFOA-exposed cells showed increased cell apoptotic count, and increased phosphorylated levels of Bcl-2 and Bad in the cells. Furthermore, PFOA-exposed liver cells exhibited elevations of CD36-labeled cells and CD36 protein. Taken together, the present data demonstrate that acute exposure to PFOA-impaired liver function is associated with inducting CD36 expression and apoptosis, as well as disrupting key hormones in the pancreas.
