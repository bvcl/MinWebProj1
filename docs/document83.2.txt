In this study, bare polycaprolactone microspheres (PCL MPs) and methotrexate (MTX) loaded PCL microspheres (MTX-PCL MPs) have been developed by oil-in-water emulsion solvent evaporation method using hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) as an emulsifier. Encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity of methotrexate were found to be 51.28%±0.52 and 2.8%±0.06 respectively. Environmental scanning electron microscopy showed the PCL MPs and MTX-PCL MPs to have a spherical shape and smooth surface morphology. The mean size of microspheres (23μm) was found within injectability criteria. High-Resolution X-ray diffraction of microspheres revealed that PCL retained its semi-crystalline nature after processing in microspheres, but the drug looses its crystallinity. Fourier transmittance infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetry analysis of the microspheres indicated that no physicochemical modification occurred. In vitro, MTX release study from MTX-PCL MPs in phosphate buffer saline (pH7.4) showed controlled release profile and only 31% of MTX released in 306h. The microspheres in lyophilized form are physicochemically stable for 8months. Furthermore, L929 cells treated with microspheres showed cell viability &gt;80%. The different concentrations of microspheres found hemocompatible and did not affect the biconcave shape of red blood cells (RBCs). The physiochemical and biological evaluation of microspheres suggests their further use for drug delivery application.
