We read with great interest the study of Valka et al. [1], recently published and we would like to reinforce the importance of DNA repair genes in the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The authors monitored and detected a differential expression of panel containing 84 DNA repair-associated genes in samples of CD34+ cells of MDS patients [1]. Here, we would like to complement the Valka et al. [1] study with our new recent analyzes of gene expression in a panel of 14 DNA repair genes (ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51, XRCC5, XRCC6, LIG4, XPA, XPC, XPD/ERCC2, XPF/ERCC4, XPG/ERCC5, CSA/ERCC8 and CSB/ERCC6) in CD34+ stem cell samples, using quantitative PCR methodologies, and it's relation with clinical laboratory variables of Brazilian MDS patients.
