To illustrate the association of MDR1 (Multidrug Resistance 1) polymorphisms at loci 1236, 2677, 3435 and the prognosis of multiple myeloma (MM) in Jiangsu population.METHODS: A total of 129 MM patients were recruited from Jiangsu Province, China. The DNA was extracted from white blood cells (WBC) of peripheral blood and was amplified by polymerase chain reaction-allele specific primers (PCR-ASP). MDR1 polymorphisms at 3 loci were analyzed by electrophoresis followed by photograph or DNA direct sequencing. The association between the MDR1 and clinical outcomes were calculated by Graphpad and SPSS.RESULTS: MDR1 alleles at locus C1236T with T had significant lower calcium level in MM patients compared with C. The genotype CT had a significantly prolonged progress free survival (PFS) compared genotype CC at locus C1236T (median time: 48 months vs. 28 months, respectively; p=0.0062; HR=0.21; 95%CI0.061-0.715) while patients carrying T allele (CT and TT) at locus C3435T had a longer PFS than patients without T allele (CC) (median time: 60 months vs. 29 months, respectively; p=0.038; HR=0.508; 95%CI 0.264-0.978). And a borderline significance was found in haplotype at loci 2677-3435 and PFS. No significant findings were revealed between OS and MDR1 polymorphisms.CONCLUSION: MDR1 polymorphisms could affect the prognosis of multiple myeloma whereas more samples and a longer follow-up are also needed.
